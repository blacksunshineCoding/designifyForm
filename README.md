# designifyForm
A collection of js/jquery and css tools to make your html forms look amazing and fancy

## what it does
- designifyForm and its components make your form elements look amazing and fancy. no more ugly browser form elements.
- there are 4 sizes available for your elements: small, default, large and xlarge
- different styles for your elements: edged, rounded, circle
- different colors and hover effects for your elements
- different icons (for example on selects/etc)
- possibility to use labels for your form elements
- highly customizable - you can just overrule the default css styles because of the easy usable html syntax

## variants
there are two variants available: pures css and as jquery plugin. each one has its own benefits for different areas of application.

### pure css
 - works with pure html syntax only just by including the css file
 - this variant can best be used when you have the possibility to write the whole html for your forms/etc by yourself
 - you should not use every possible javascript/jquery plugin, especially when there are good working pure css alternatives

### jquery plugin
- works by simply including the jquery file and apply it with a selector on your form elements
- there is no special html syntax needed
- if you have no possibility to change the form html because you are using given system with a default form module, the jquery variant is the best solution

## collection
there will be a version that contains all of the components in one file (css/js). this is great when you have all types of form elements and you need to make them all look amazing and fancy.

if you just need one ore some components it will be more efficient if you use them as single component
